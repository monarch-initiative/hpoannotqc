# HPO Annotation Q/C




This application is designed to transform the internal HPO Annotation files (the small files)
together with the Orphanet XML file into the
[phenotype.hpoa](https://hpo.jax.org/data/annotations){:target="_blank"} file. It performs extensive Q/C on
the annotation files, and creates the **phenotype.hpoa** file.
